        <h4>Observations</h4>
        <p>
            There is a lot of variation in sleep duration across the globe. Some
            countries have an average of less than 7 hours of sleep per night,
            while others have almost 8 hours!
        </p>
        <p>
            It's difficult to guess why this variation exists but it could be a
            result of cultural differences (i.e. work and family expectations),
            but even things like the climate of the country could play a role.

            Important Note: This data was collected by sleepcycle.com, a sleep
            tracking app. This means that the data is could be biased towards
            people who are more likely to use sleep tracking apps. Keeping this
            in mind, it may lead to more accurate conclusions to focus on
            general trends and relations between data of different countries
            rather than specific numbers.

            For this visualization lighter blues indicate less sleep, darker
            blues indicate more sleep, and grey indicates missing data.
