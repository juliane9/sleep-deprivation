        <h4>Observations</h4>
        <p>
            There is far more variety in this data than was initially expected.
            There are some counties with less than 25% prevalence of short sleep
            and there are some with even more than 50%!
        </p>
        <p>
            Further examination is necessary to understand exactly why there is
            so much variation. But this data could be utilized to target
            specific districts with the goal of further reinforcing the
            importance of sleep in early school curriculum.

            It is also important to note that there are a couple of missing
            counties, signified by grey boxes. These counties' data was not
            present in the CDC PLACES dataset.

            Note that darker reds imply higher prevalence of insufficient sleep.
            Insufficient sleep is defined as less than 7 hours of sleep per
            24-hour period on average.
