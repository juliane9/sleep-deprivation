<h1>How Sleep Deprivation Impacts Your Daily Life</h1>
<p class="intro-text">
  Research has shown that sleep deprivation negatively affects both physical and mental well-being.
  The visualizations below illustrate the impact of sleep duration and quality on various physiological and cognitive functions.

  <h4>Observations</h4>
  <p>
    Sleep deprivation has widespread negative effects on both mental and physical well-being, as demonstrated in the
    visualizations. One clear trend is the strong relationship between sleep hours and stress levels. Those who sleep
    fewer hours report significantly higher stress. As shown in the Sleep Hours vs. Stress Level visualization, inadequate
    sleep is directly linked to elevated cortisol production and impaired emotional resilience. Similarly, daytime sleepiness
    increases with fewer hours of sleep, as shown in the Daytime Sleepiness & Emotion Regulation by Sleep Hours visualization.
    In the Sleep vs. BMI (Body Mass Index) visualization, BMI trends show irregular fluctuations, but overall, sleep deprivation
    disrupts metabolic processes, leading to higher body weight and an increased risk of obesity. Lastly, the Sleep Quality vs.
    Physical Activity visualization highlights the importance of sleep quality and illustrates how poor sleep quality correlates
    with reduced physical activity levels. A bad night of sleep often leads to reduced motivation for movement, contributing to
    sedentary behavior. Given these patterns, prioritizing adequate sleep is crucial for maintaining cognitive performance, emotional
    stability, physical activity, and overall health. It is worth noting, however, that despite longer and higher-quality sleep often
    being associated with lower stress and increased physical activity, the effects start to plateau at around seven hours of sleep.
    Therefore, a minimum of seven hours of sleep is recommended to sustain energy throughout the day.
